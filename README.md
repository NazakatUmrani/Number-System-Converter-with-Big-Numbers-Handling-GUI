This is a project I have worked on in the past, it was a console app.
Now I have converted it into GUI.

This is a number system converter, with some extra powers of big numbers handling, I have made some functions that are able to perform arithmetic operations on big numbers, Which means you can perform any conversion, and there is no limit to conversions.

Console based app is still available in this repository
